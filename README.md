## overview

This code is the project of MSBD5014A in Fall 2022 supervised by Ke Yi, and the project title is SQl over Differential privacy.

Primary source paper is: 

```
   "Shifted Inverse: A General Mechanism for Monotonic Functions under User Differential Privacy."
   Juanru Fang, Wei Dong, Ke Yi.
   ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), November 2022.
```

and one background paper:

```
   "R2T: Instance-optimal Truncation for Differentially Private Query Evaluation with Foreign Keys."
   Wei Dong, Juanru Fang, Ke Yi, Yuchao Tao, and Ashwin Machanavajjhala.

## software

- we use **python** for programming language.
- we use **postgreSQL** as the relational database.
- we use **cplex** for solving linear program.

## Dependencies

check requirement file in the repo.

- **psycopg2, config** for connecting database.
- **docplex, cplex** for solving linear program.
- **numpy** for calculation.
- **tqdm, matplotlib** for visualization.

## Usage

after setting up all the software, you need to prepare a file where you write your query.

Application options can be seen with:

```
python main.py --help
```

usage of arguments:

- **db**, filepath of database connect, default will be _database.ini_.
- **query**, filepath of query, default will be _q12_.
- **type**, type of the query (may be modified later), default will be _1_, corresponding to q12.
- **out**, filepath of the output which is a probability density, default will be _prob_density.png_.
Sample:

```
python main.py --db ./database.ini --q ./q12 --t 1 --out ./prob_density.png
```
